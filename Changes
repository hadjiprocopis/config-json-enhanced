        -Added the ability for the user to use
        custom comment style by specifying
        an opening and, optionally, a closing comment
        string. By adding a new
        comment style: 'custom()()'.
        -Added the ability for the user to specify
        if comments within strings
        (keys or scalar string values in the JSON) should
        be retained or removed. By adding a new
        optional parameter 'remove-comments-in-strings'
        to sub 'config2perl()'.
        -Added the ability for the user to increase
        verbosity of sub 'config2perl()'.
        The verbatim sections are checked for
        templated variables but do not have
        any comments contained in them to be
        replaced. All comments in Verbatim Sections
        are now left as they are.
        -Added the ability for the user to select
        tags for denoting variables and verbatim sections,
        the default value is '<%' and '%>'.
        -Made documentation's SYNOPSIS clearer.
        -Added 'META_MERGE' key in Makefile.PL.
        -Added CI via github actions (thanks https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11127196 and https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11154429).

        -Changed the regex for identifying comments, variables,
        verbatime sections to no need escaping special regex characters.
        -Added one more test for testing tags of comments, variables, etc.

0.09    06-10-2023 / 18:00
        Added one more test (t/300-tags-clashing.t)
        for testing if comment tags are the same as the other tags.

0.10    12-03-2023 / 19:15
        Scripts for command-line functionality are provided:
        configjson2json.pl  configjson2perl.pl	configjson2.yaml.pl
        Dependency 'Data::Roundtrip' must now have minimum version of 0.16
        because prior to that json2perl() was die'ing on failure as opposed
        to returning undef which is what we expected in the tests.
